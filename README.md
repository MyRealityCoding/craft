A crafting game for Android. In this game you can craft different items. Those items can be used in other games. Furthermore items (recipes, gems and ores) can be achieved in other games as well.

To make this happen, I'm also providing an API where game developer can submit own items and apps.

Getting started
---
To get started with this game, [read the official wiki](https://github.com/MyRealityCoding/craft/wiki).

API
---
This game works with the official Craft API. This API is in another repository. The whole API is a node.js application with MongoDB and returns json only. If you want to get familiar with the api, read the official wiki. (not finished yet)

Development
---
The game is developed by [Miguel Gonzalez](http://my-reality.de).
